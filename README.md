# Hegswarm

Hegswarm is a small project written in **Godot version 4**. The core idea is to play as a self-replicating van Neumann drone moving through a procedurally generated galaxy. You mine asteroids and planets for resources which can then be used to build new drones and factories.

## Ideas to Explore

- **Procedural Galaxy**: Each playthrough generates unique star systems filled with mineable planets and asteroids.
- **Automation**: Build factories and additional drones to automate resource gathering and production.
- **Exploration and Expansion**: Use new drones to scout distant systems, expanding your reach and discovering more materials.
- **Resource Management**: Balance mined materials between expanding your swarm and powering existing structures.

The project is in its early stages, so feel free to experiment with the world generation script in `scripts/world_generation.gd`.

## Development Notes

This repository targets **Godot version 4**. Contributors should use GDScript 2.0 syntax and ensure that any scenes or scripts remain compatible with Godot 4's features.
